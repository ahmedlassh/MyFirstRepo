# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Ahmed Lasheen. I am a university student studying Business Administration and Data Analysis. I have a strong passion for technology, especially data science, marketing, and Salesforce systems.

In my free time, I also love reading, working on startup ideas, and helping my community grow through educational initiatives.
